# lite-xl-mdpreview
a markdown previewer for [lite-xl](https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl) using [luamd](https://github.com/bakpakin/luamd).

## Installation

clone the git repository into your lite-xl plugins folder. that's it.

**Note**: I do realise it's not exactly working at the moment, i'm still trying to figure out its issues.
