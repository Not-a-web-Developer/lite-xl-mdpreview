# lite-xl-mdpreview
a markdown previewer for [LiteXL](https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl) using [luamd](https://github.com/bakpakin/luamd).

## Installation

clone the git repository into your lite-xl plugins folder like so:
```sh
git clone https://not-a-web-developer/lite-xl-mdpreview mdpreview
```
that's it.

**Note**: I do realise it's not exactly working with some files at the moment, i'm still trying to figure out its issues.
